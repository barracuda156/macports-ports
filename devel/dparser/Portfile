description         General-purpose parser generator
long_description \
    DParser is a simple but powerful tool for parsing. You can specify \
    the form of the text to be parsed using a combination of regular \
    expressions and grammar productions. Because of the parsing technique \
    (technically a scannerless GLR parser based on the Tomita algorithm) \
    there are no restrictions. The grammar can be ambiguous, right or \
    left recursive, have any number of null productions, and because there \
    is no seperate tokenizer, can include whitespace in terminals and have \
    terminals which are prefixes of other terminals. DParser handles not \
    just well formed computer languages and data files, but just about any \
    wacky situation that occurs in the real world.
