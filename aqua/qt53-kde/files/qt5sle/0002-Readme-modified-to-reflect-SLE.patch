+QT5 SNOW LEOPARD EDITION
+========================
+
+QT5 SLE is a fork of the Qt 5.3.2 branch from qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.3.2.tar.gz file distributed source code. Unfortunately it looks like it was removed from the qt5 archive (https:/download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.3/) but there are mirrors for it.
+
+Qt 5.3.2 is the last snow leopard compatible version. It was only available via compilation of source, no .dmg or .pkg provided. This source code is tested with Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard.
+
+
+Patches are applied to allow for proper compilation (clang 3.0 is the target, no c++11) and important fixes. 
+
+The source code includes the following improvements:
+
+- https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/87048
+- https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-38568
+- https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdeclarative/+/84760
+- https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-40039
+
+
+I have heard it's possible to get a later version of gcc on the mac through macports, but with Snow Leopard's SSL expired certificate, it is difficult if not impossible to use macports for fetching and building software to expand the system. 
+
+I will be taking Windows XP bug reports as I would like to eventually ensure some compatibility with that OS as well.
+
+
+Here is the command I use to configure Qt 5.3.2 SLE:
+
+    ./configure -no-c++11 -no-sql-mysql -qt-sql-sqlite -sdk macosx10.6 -I /usr/local/pgsql/include/ -L /usr/local/pgsql/lib/ -qt-sql-psql -debug-and-release -nomake tests -nomake examples -opensource -confirm-license
+
+(Remove the psql flags if you are not compiling for that. You will need psql installed via source, as the binary version and the binaries zip file cause zlib conflicts.)
